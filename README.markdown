# About DoxycleanApp

Everyone recognizes the need for better documentation.  For Mac programming using Objective-C, [Doxygen][doxygen] is a pretty good documentation system.  Unfortunately, the default documentation template in no way matches the standard set by Apple's documentation.  Fortunately, Matt Ball has released [Doxyclean](doxyclean), a means of using Doxygen's generated XML documentation and converting it into a much more stylish form.

DoxycleanApp simply tries to make using Doxyclean a little easier.  DoxycleanApp is a GUI over Doxyclean that lets you easily set all of the necessary options while also letting you automatically run Doxygen prior to running Doxyclean.
